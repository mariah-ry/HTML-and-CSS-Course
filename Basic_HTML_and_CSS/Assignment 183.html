				The answer is yes, it does.<br>
				<br>Everywhere you go, there is a Starbucks. Be it any grocery store, Barnes & Noble, or looking across the street.<br>

				Maybe it would be better to just get rid of them altogether. But we're not going to do that.<br>
				<br>The convenience of Starbucks is something that other coffee shops just don't offer. The mobile<br>
				app, the drive throughs, the wide variety of locations. It's good stuff.

				I think a better option is just for Starbucks to improve the quality of their coffee. No more lattes that taste like acid at 9:00&nbsp;a.m.
